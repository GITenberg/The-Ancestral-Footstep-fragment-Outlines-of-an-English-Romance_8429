description: Hawthorne struggled in vain to complete this fragment of a romance for
  more than twenty years. Based on an old English legend of a bloody footprint, it
  illuminates many of the themes Hawthorne touched on in his greatest works, as well
  as his methods of composition. It was published posthumously in 1883.
